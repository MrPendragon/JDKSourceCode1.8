/**
 * 一种可重入互斥{@link Lock}，其基本行为和语义与使用{@code synchronized}修饰的方法对应的隐式监视器锁相同，但具有扩展功能。
 *
 * {@code ReentrantLock}由上次成功锁定但尚未释放的线程拥有。
 * 当锁闲置时，调用{@code lock}的线程将会获取到锁并直接返回。
 * 如果当前线程已经持有锁，则该方法将立即返回。
 * 可以使用方法{@link #isHeldByCurrentThread}和{@link #getHoldCount} 来判断是否持有。
 *
 * <p>
 * 构造函数接受可选的参数来生成公平锁和非公平锁。（true——公平锁）
 * <li>公平锁：在竞争时，倾向于将锁赋予给等待时间最长的线程。
 * <li>非公平锁：不保证任何特定的访问顺序。
 * 非公平锁相较于公平锁有更高的并发性能。
 * 【注意】：锁的公平性并不能保证线程调度的公平性。（获取到锁只是有可运行的资格，具体调度由OS决定）
 * 因此，使用公平锁时也可能出现同一个线程被连续多次获得锁，而其他线程则拿不到锁也无法运行。
 * Also note that the untimed {@link #tryLock()} method does not
 * honor the fairness setting. It will succeed if the lock
 * is available even if other threads are waiting.
 *
 * <p>
 * 建议在调用{@code lock} 后紧接着 {@code try}块，例如：
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class X {
 *   private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
 *   // ...
 *
 *   public void m() {
 *     lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
 *     try {
 *       // ... method body
 *     } finally {
 *       lock.unlock()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
 * locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
 * its state when serialized.
 *
 * <p>This lock supports a maximum of 2147483647 recursive locks by
 * the same thread. Attempts to exceed this limit result in
 * {@link Error} throws from locking methods.
 *
